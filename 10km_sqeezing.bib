	abstract = {The distribution of continuous variable ({CV}) Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen ({EPR})-entangled beams at a telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm over single-mode fibers is investigated. {EPR}-entangled beams with quantum entanglement of 8.3 {dB} are generated using a single nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier based on a type-{II} periodically poled {KTiOPO}4 crystal. When one beam of the generated {EPR}-entangled beams is distributed over 20 km of single-mode fiber, 1.02 {dB} quantum entanglement can still be measured. The degradation of {CV} quantum entanglement in a noisy fiber channel is theoretically analyzed considering the effect of depolarized guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering in optical fibers. The theoretical prediction is in good agreement with the experimental results.},
