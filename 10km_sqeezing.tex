\begin{abstract}
We experimentally measured 5.8dB intensity squeezing generated by all-fiber system and demonstrated transmission of intensity squeezing state in 26 km telecom single mode fiber while maintaining 2dB squeezing.
Our experiment shows that the long-haul transmission of intensity squeezed state does not introduce additional noise to the intensity squeezed state.
% Our result shows that the primary limit of measured squeezing is the loss of transmission fiber, which can be improved by low loss fibers.

\section{Introduction}


Creation and distribution of the continuous-variable quantum states are important for quantum communication applications, such as teleportation, dense coding and quantum key distribution\cite{braunstein_quantum_2005}.
For long distance quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation, transmitting quantum state far enough while keeping its quantum property is essential.
Modern fiber communication networks are able to transmit light in telecom band with little loss, which is very promising for quantum communication.
There has been much endeavor in trying to transmit quantum states further[Satellite, Fiber, Air] and transmit quantum state with low loss fiber network is a nice solution.
We present an all-fiber pulsed twin beams source in telecom band which is compatible with fiber telecommunication networks.
The intensity difference squeezing out of our source is distributed over 26km single mode fiber (SMF) and still remain 2dB squeezing, which is the longest for continuous variable state distribution.
%The directly measured intensity difference squeezing is $R_{0}= 5.8$ dB.%, which is the best reported in fiber system.
%Besides, twin beams generated in telecom band by fiber system are compatible with conventional single mode fiber (SMF). %, and suffers way much less coupling loss into SMF. % (around 4\% splicing loss and can be less if the fibers are properly tapered before splicing) than those generated by crystals and atom systems.%degrades the squeezing by introducing new vacuum.

% basic results
In this letter, we present a pulsed twin beam source in telecom band via Stimulated Four Wave Mixing (FWM) in Dispersion Shifted Fiber (DSF) and transmit it by two Single Mode Fiber (SMF). The initial directly measured intensity directly difference squeezing is $R_{0}= 6 dB$, which is the best reported in fiber system. Besides, twin beams generated in telecom band by fiber system are compatible with conventional SMF, and suffers less coupling loss, which is generally inevitable for those generated by crystals and atom systems.%degrades the squeezing by introducing new vacuum.

We managed to lunch the twin beams into individual SMF.
After propagating in SMF for 10km, the measured normalized noise power is still 2dB below shot noise limit defined by detected intensity. Comparing to theoretical prediction, the only limitation for further propagation is the fiber transmission loss, which can be improved with the help of low loss fiber. Thus, our twin beam source has great potential in quantum information and quantum cryptology.

\label{fig_setup}

\end{figure}
The experiment setup is shown in Fig. \ref{fig_setup}.
The non-degenerate twin beams are generated from a pulse pumped fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) utilizing four wave mixing effect between strong pump and week seed injection via \(\chi^{(3)} \) nonlinear interaction in 300 m DSF fiber.
The zero dispersion wavelength of DSF is 1548.5 nm when cooled at 77 k by liquid nitrogen, which reduces additional raman noise in generated twin beams \cite{guo12}.
The Zero Dispersion Wavelength (ZDW) of DSF is 1552.6 at room temperature and shifts to 1548.5 nm when cooled at 77k by liquid nitrogen, which improves the quality of generated twin beam \cite{guo12}.
%% filter
For simplicity of narration, we denote the beam in shorter injecting wavelength signal and the conjugate beam in longer wavelength as idler.
The pump and seed are filtered separately from a mode-locked laser by Programable Filter (PF1), and the center wavelength and bandwidth of pump (seed) are 1549.5 nm (1533 nm) and 0.7 nm (1.5 nm) respectively.
After PF1, the filtered pump is further amplified by Erbium-doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) to meet the required power while the seed is delayed by a mechanical delay-line so as to keep overlapped with pump in DSF.
The amplified pump and seed is combined at the PF2 and feed into DSF where twin beams are generated via FWM.
Besides, PF2 also filter out ASE from EDFA and compensate dispersion from previous fiber system, which helps to increase the gain of OPA.
After amplification in DSF, twin beams are generated and separated by 15nm bandwidth Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexer (CWDM), which has 90\% and 86\% transmission efficiency in signal (centered at 1531nm) and idler channel (centered at 1571nm)  respectively with DSF-SMF splicing loss at the output of DSF(4\%) and SMF-SMF splicing loss between CWDM filters(<1\%) included.
%% transmission
The separated twin beam is transmitted individually by single mode Fiber Coil FC1 and FC2, which has equal length so as to simplify the detection system.
The SMF used has typical 0.2dB/km transmission loss and the length is set to 0, 2, 5, 8 and 13 km, corresponding to distribution of entangled source by 0, 4, 10, 16, 26 km respectively, so as to demonstrate the potential of twin beam in long haul quantum resource distribution.
The signal and idler of twin are detected by a Balanced Detector (BD) directly. The BD used in our experiment is modified Thorlabs PDB450C, with detectors replaced by high quantum efficiency (96\% with coupling efficiency included) InGaAs Pin detectors from Laser Components.
To balance the intensity difference between signal and idler field caused by stimulated Raman amplification, the idler field is attenuated slightly(1-2\%)\cite{guo12}.


\section{Results}

We first measure the twin beam directly after the generation so as to evaluate the quality.
Intensity difference squeezing of twin beam is evaluated by the ratio between intensity difference noise of twin beam and SNL at identical intensity on detectors of BD.
Fig. \ref{fig2_OPA}(a) shows the measured intensity difference squeezing at different OPA gain with the insert showing the gain of OPA at different pump power.
It can be seen that the maximum squeezing reached in our experiment is 5.8dB when the power gain of OPA is arond 30.
The measured squeezing decrease slightly when the gain of OPA increase further, which is probably caused by raman effect who introduce additional noise to both signal and idler field.

In fig. \ref{fig2_OPA}(b) shows the best noise reduction result read on the DAQ system when pump power is 1.4 mW and intensity of signal and idler field is both around 15 uW. Line(2) is the intensity difference noised with line(1) is recorded corresponding SNL with identical intensity. It's obvious to around 5.8 dB noise reduction from SNL. Even though, the best result cancels out Electronic Noise (EN) shown by line3, the influence over uncorrected squeezing is no more than a slight change.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Performance of intensity difference squeezing. (a) Gain curve. (b) Maximum intensity difference squeezing measured. (c) SQZ vs Power gain}
\label{fig2_OPA}
\end{figure}

According to previous works [???], for twin beam possess $R_0$ initial intensity difference squeezing, the measurable intensity difference squeezing $ R(\eta)$ after detecting with quantum efficiency $\eta$ can be simplified as:
\begin{equation}
R(\eta) = 1+\eta(R_0-1)
\label{eq:loss}
\end{equation}

This relations defines the upper limit of quantum resource left after a certain amount of loss. According to this relation, the normalized intensity noise generated from OPA is more than 7dB after efficiency correction(90\% for signal field and 85 for idler field).	



Based on this equation, we calculated the normalized intensity noise at different transmission loss after CWDMs and plotted by blue line in fig. \ref{fig_loss}. The top axis is the signal field detection efficiency, and the bottom axis is the length of SMF that cause same amount of transmission loss. As shown in the figure, intensity squeezing can endure a pretty long SMF transmission and keep more than 2dB squeezing after distributing the twin beam by 26km, which means 13km SMF on signal and idler channel respectively.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Sqz_vs_Length_dB_color.jpg}
\caption{Measurable intensity difference squeezing at different transmission loss}
\label{fig_loss}
\end{figure}

After analysis above, we lunch the generated twin beam into two SMF, the output from two SMF are detected by BD show in fig. \ref{fig_setup}.
After different length of fiber, the attenuation caused by fiber transmission loss makes the measured intensity squeezing degrade accordingly.
The relation between fiber length and measured normalized intensity difference noise is plot as red dots in fig. \ref{fig_loss}.
Comparing to theoretical prediction plot as blue line, the experiment result agrees well with the equation (\ref{eq:loss}), which means there is no other additional noise introduced while distributing the twin beam and the only limitation is the transmission loss of SMF, which can be improved by utilizing ultra low loss fibers that introduce 0.16 dB/km transmission loss [???find someone].


\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we experimentally built an all fiber twin beam source that possess 5.8 dB direct measurable intensity squeezing.
The generated twin beam is distributed by 26 km and still remains 2 db squeezing, which fits theoretical prediction well. Considering our all fiber twin beam source is the best in record (5.8dB) and pretty compatible with conventional fiber communication systems, this source shows great potential in quantum conmmucation and long distance quantum metrology.
