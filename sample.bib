	abstract = {Stemming from the pursuit of a simple system to produce squeezed state for long distance continuous variable quantum communication, we present an all-fibre source of pulsed twin beams at 1550 nm band by using a high gain fiber optical parametric amplifier. The noise of intensity difference of the twin beams is below the shot noise limit by 3.1 {dB} (10.4 {dB} after correction for losses).},
